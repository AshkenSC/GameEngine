# Learning-OpenGL-GameEngine

This is a simple OpenGL game engine that I am trying to develop using LWJGL.
I have been developing this engine based on a tutorial made by ThinMatrix on YouTube, 
in order to learn OpenGL and better understand how a game works. 
Thank him very much for his efforts and detailed explanations.
